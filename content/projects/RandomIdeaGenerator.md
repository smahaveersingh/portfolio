 - Developed a system that will simulate the movement and interaction of various Monsters placed on Board (10 x 10 cells [squares]).

 - Enabling the fight action will cause the Monster’s to fight and the strongest monster will win, accumulating the power of the monsters it has beaten.

 - My game design process includes 6 stages – capture, brainstorm, prototype, playtest, iterate and implement.
