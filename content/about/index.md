I am a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform .

Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. I'm interested in Student Politics and spent time whenever possible towards student resource development in DKIT.

In my free time you can find me working out at the gym or at the beach.

These are all the technologies i use working at [obelisk](https://www.obelisk.com/)
